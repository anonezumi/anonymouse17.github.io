	<h1>Discord Bots</h1>
	<p>
		I love making random bots that interact on Discord.
		To make them, I use Python and a library called discord.py.
		Here are my 3 public discord bots.
	</p>
	<h2>Logbot</h2>
	<p>
		Logbot is my first ever Discord bot.
		It has a very specific purpose: to log messages from one person in one channel to another channel.
		It was made to form a new way to present results in TWOWs.<br> <br>
		I'd like to thank hanss314 for helping with development (porting to discord.py rewrite + other fixes), and hosting the bot for me on his VPS!<br> <br>

	</p>
	<h2>Project Season 2</h2>
	<p>
		Project Season 2 is my second Discord bot.
		Its main purpose is to read "scripts" generated by TWOWSimulator.
		However, I also included a command to tell it to send one of hundreds of computer-generated TWOW responses.
		They were generated using a neural network called <a href="https://github.com/jcjohnson/torch-rnn">torch-rnn</a>, similar to what carykh used in one of his videos.<br> <br>
		<a href="https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=352536522211196928&scope=bot">Add it to your server here!</a>
	</p>
	<h2>FMK</h2>
	<p>
		FMK is my third, and most goofy bot.
		Its only function is to play the popular game FMK, or "F**k, Marry, Kill".
		It simply picks random TWOWers out of a list, and makes an image with the three of them together.
		The art it uses is provided by JPomz.<br> <br>
