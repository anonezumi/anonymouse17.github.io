    <h1>ComfortClass: Code Comfortably.</h1>
    <img src="/img/comfortclass_logo.png">
    ComfortClass is a programming language in early development, designed by yours truly.
    It's object-oriented, and draws heavily from Python, which is also the language it's implemented in.
    ComfortClass' design is based on the concept of comfort.
    <h2>What do you mean by comfort?</h2>
    I'm glad you asked.
    Comfort can take many different forms. Here are the main ones:
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Simplicity.</strong> ComfortClass is easy to learn.
            <ul>
                <li>It has no memory management or references.</li>
                <li>The syntax is unambiguous and easy to comprehend.</li>
                <li>It doesn't require explicit type declarations, and allows for very easy casting.</li>
                <li>It's not verbose, but not hard to read.</li>
            </ul>
        </li> <br>
        <li>
            <strong>Ease of transition.</strong> ComfortClass is similar to many major languages.
            <ul>
                <li>The syntax is C-like, similar to a large number of popular languages.</li>
                <li>There are (planned) direct ports of python modules to ComfortClass.</li>
                <li>It doesn't have strange restrictions that throw you through a loop.</li>
                <!--<li>[TODO: Make comparison, link here]</li>-->
            </ul>
        </li> <br>
        <li>
            <strong>Security.</strong> ComfortClass gives you total control over the features you want to use.
            <ul>
                <li>It doesn't have a full-fledged standard library.</li>
                <li>All ComfortClass modules are open-source by nature.</li>
                <li>It also doesn't have any tricky builtins like Python does.</li>
                <li>All this allows for <strong>easy arbitrary code execution.</strong></li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Can I use ComfortClass?</h2>
    Not yet, unfortunately. ComfortClass and its documentation are in early development right now.
    However, you can see how it's doing and track the progress by going to <a href="https://github.com/anonymouse17/comfortclass">the repository</a>.
