	<h2>TWOWSimulator</h2>
	TWOWSimulator is a project that attempts to simulate TWOW as fast and accurate as possible, and it's open-source! The github hasn't been updated in quite a while, though. <br> <br>
	<a href="https://github.com/anonymouse17/TWOWSimulator">Here it is anyway!</a>
    <h2>Logbot</h2>
    Logbot is my first ever Discord bot.
    It has a very specific purpose: to log messages from one person in one channel to another channel.
    It was made to form a new way to present results in TWOWs.<br> <br>
    I'd like to thank hanss314 for helping with development (porting to discord.py rewrite + other fixes), and hosting the bot for me on his VPS!<br> <br>

	<h2>Project Season 2</h2>
    Project Season 2 is my second Discord bot.
    Its main purpose is to read "scripts" generated by TWOWSimulator.
    However, I also included a command to tell it to send one of hundreds of computer-generated TWOW responses.
    They were generated using a neural network called <a href="https://github.com/jcjohnson/torch-rnn">torch-rnn</a>, similar to what carykh used in one of his videos.<br> <br>
    Unfortunately, I am no longer actively supporting and hosting this bot. <br> <br>
	<h2>FMK</h2>
    FMK is my third, and most goofy bot.
    Its only function is to play the popular game FMK, or "F**k, Marry, Kill".
    It simply picks random TWOWers out of a list, and makes an image with the three of them together.
    The art it uses is provided by JPomz.<br> <br>
    Unfortunately, I am no longer actively supporting and hosting this bot. <br> <br>
